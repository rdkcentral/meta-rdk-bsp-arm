Subject: [PATCH 11/13] service: dhcpv6_client: log to syslog instead of
 /dev/console

During bring up of the Arm generic machine, I noticed quite a few logs to
console with this message:
Usage: dhcpv6_client [ dhcpv6_client-start | dhcpv6_client-stop | dhcpv6_client-restart]

The underlying issue is with SelfHeal, but in any case, it is better
for these logs to go to syslog (/var/log/user)
