# U-Boot for QEMU Arm64 Virtual Machine

This recipe provides a more recent copy of U-Boot with
[standard boot support](https://docs.u-boot.org/en/latest/develop/bootstd/index.html),
which provides significantly more robust support for EFI (and other) boot methods
than the older version provided by Yocto Kirkstone.
